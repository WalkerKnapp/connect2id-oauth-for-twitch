# Nimbus OAuth 2.0 & 2.1 SDK with OpenID Connect extensions

Copyright (c) Connect2id Ltd., 2012 - 2022

This open source SDK is your starting point for developing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID
Connect based applications in Java. It is provided under the terms of the

## About OAuth 2.0 and 2.1

[OAuth 2.0](https://connect2id.com/learn/oauth-2) is an authorisation framework 
for a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, 
either on behalf of a resource owner (the user), or by allowing the third-party 
application to obtain access on its own behalf.

OAuth 2.0 is specified in [RFC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and 
its companion specifications.

[OAuth 2.1](https://connect2id.com/learn/oauth-2-1) is a [working 
draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-02) that rolls the 
original OAuth 2.0 RFC and best practises established over the years into a 
simpler, safer and more streamlined authorisation framework.


## About OpenID Connect 1.0

[OpenID Connect 1.0](https://connect2id.com/learn/openid-connect) is a simple 
identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. Relying parties (clients) 
verify the identity of the user based on the authentication performed by an 
authorisation server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the 
user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

OpenID Connect enables clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile, and 
JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated 
sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, allowing 
optional encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and 
session management.

Go to the [OpenID Connect specifications](http://openid.net/connect/) for more 
details.
